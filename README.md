# Meme Reactor

Meme Reactor is an web app that takes two top text and the bottom text from the user and shows a random meme with given text. It is simply a meme generator. As its name suggest, it is developed with React.js.

*The app idea is originated from [Bob Ziroll](https://scrimba.com/@bobziroll)'s Scrimba course.*

## The Memes

Once the MemeGenerator component is mounted, a list of memes is fetched via [Imgflip API](https://api.imgflip.com/) and stored to the component's state.
